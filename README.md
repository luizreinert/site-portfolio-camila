## Overview

- This project consists of a full-stack web application, where the frontend and backend communicate via a RESTful API. 
- The frontend was designed in Figma and developed with React.js for a dynamic and responsive interface. The backend is a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express, handling data storage, image management, and client inquiries. A MySQL database stores the relevant data, and cloud storage is used for hosting media files.
